# misclass-covid-19-testing

This repo contains an R markdown script implementing some of the analyses in "Towards reduction in bias in epidemic curves due to outcome misclassification through Bayesian analysis of time-series of laboratory test results: Case study of COVID-19 in Alberta, Canada and Philadelphia, USA," by Burstyn, Goldstein, and Gustafson.

Note that the .Rmd can take either the Alberta data or the Philadelphia data as input, with the two .pdf files showing the respective output.
